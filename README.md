# Cameron HayGlass
* Happily a Canadian professional nerd. **I love helping people build software that helps people**.
* I was an engineer for ten years, and now I've been in product since 2017.
* Empathy, communication and relentless curiousity are the secret to everything. 
* I love travel, weird beer, cats, sports and [nerd-sniping](https://xkcd.com/356/) myself. 
* You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chayglass/) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chayglass.bsky.social)
* I am also passionate about my work with [CFL Fans Fight Cancer](https://www.cflfansfightcancer.com)
